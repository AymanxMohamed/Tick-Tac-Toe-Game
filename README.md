</p>

### Application Design
 - in this game the client is actualy nothing 
 - The `Server` is the big boss her :)
#### Client Application

The client application consists mainly of 4 packages

- `controllers`: This pacakage is Responsible for dealing with the game views

- `models`: This package is for storing the data of the entities that send from the server
    - `player`
    - `singleModeHistory`
    - `multiModeHistory`

- `netwok`:` This package is the responsable for every thing it has the classes That responsable for dealiing with the server 
    - `Client` this object  is the responsable for open a socket with the server 
        - it has an `acceptResponse` method  that  have a `runnable` object that keep reading the buffer to accept  a response from t he server
        - once it read a  request it pass it to the next object to handle it  `ResponseHandler`
        - The `client` also has a `sendRequest` function that sends  a request to the server as a json string so the server can parse it and send a response after it.
    - `ResponseHandler` This object has a function `handleResponse` that takes a response from the server and do a certin action according to this response.
    - `RequestCreator` this is a utility class that is responsable for creating the json objects and return a string to be send to the server.

#### Server Application

The big boss in this  app The server is the responsable for every thing
- validating player  data
- connecting with the database 
- stablish the conection between players
- reciving the message from player and send it to the other one etc...

The  server has mainly 4 packages 

- `database` This package is the responsable for dealing with the database and it has mainly utility class `DatabaseManager` that do every thing
    - `DatabaseManager` this class is the responsable for managing any `CRUD` operatin throw the application life cycle
- `network` same as the client this package it the responsable for dealing with all the clients in connected to the server. it has mainly 4 objects to do this.
    - Server this calss is the responsable for  accepting new clients socket then passing it to the next object `playerHandler`
    - `playerHandler` each client has a playerHandler for him to acceptReqeust and send a response from him this object has 2 main methods to do thi
        - `AcceptReqeust` it's the opposite of the `AcceptRespoonse` of the client
        this method takes a request as a json from the client and pass it to the next Object `RequestHandler` to handle this request and return immediatelty a certain `response` to send it back to the client.
    - `RequestHandler` This object is a class that have handleRequest method that takes the user request and sends an approbriate  response to the `player` with the help of the next object.
    - `ResponseCreator` it's a utility class that create a `response` as a `json object` to be send to the `player`

    
- `gameLogic` this package has 3 classes that mainly control the game and chat process
    - `singleModeGameHandler`
    - `multiModeGameHandler`
    - `chatRoomHandler`

## How to play

- First Clone The Project
- Create the database schema 
  - you have to use Microsoft sql server
  - go to the /'00 Project Materials'/'00 Database'/'02 Database quires' and open 'new Database Schema.sql' file in your database management studio
  - after creating the data base you have to add user to the database
    - username: ayman
    - password: @01208538504@
    - databaename: TicTacToe
    - or simbly create new database but in this case you have to change the configuration in DatabaseManager.openDatabaseConnection Method

</p>


  - After creating the database you can now build and run the server project using netbeans or intellij idea as a maven project
  - you can lunch the Client App using the executable jar file or using netbeans or intellij idea
  - You can download the jar file from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kxtF2Oac1KPSkNlT367PQZKnHkjNJ6Zg?usp=sharing
